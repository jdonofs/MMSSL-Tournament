"""Diagnose the tracker's ball-coordinate feed directly against Dolphin.

The feed depends on reading the ball's position out of a live object in the
emulated game's memory. When that read stops landing on the position field the
failure is silent and total -- coordinates read fine, never change, and every
downstream metric (exit velocity, launch angle, distance, pitch type) produces
nothing at all with no error in the log to say why. It looks exactly like a
broken batted-ball state machine, which is a very expensive thing to chase.

This probe answers the question directly, without the tracker in the way:

    pip install dolphin-memory-engine
    python scripts/probe_ball_memory.py            # locate and verify
    python scripts/probe_ball_memory.py --watch 25 # then swing at something

`--watch` samples the object while you play and reports which offsets actually
move. The real position field is the one that traces a trajectory; anything
else is a field that happens to sit nearby.

Known history: the offset was 0x558 when this feed was built and moved to
0x4B4, with the object pointer itself unchanged. That is why the tracker now
calibrates the offset at runtime from the pitch-reset signature rather than
hardcoding it (see patch_tracker_advanced_stats.py).
