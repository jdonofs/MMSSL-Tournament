numbers rather than an error.

WHAT IS MEASURED, AND WHAT EACH ONE NEEDS TO BE HONEST

  reaction        Seconds from contact until a fielder's speed first clears a
                  threshold. Measured against the CONTACT frame, not the pitch,
                  because the fielder cannot react to a ball that has not been
                  hit.
  route efficiency  Straight-line distance from where a fielder started to
                  where they ended, over the distance they actually covered.
                  Only meaningful for the fielder who went after the ball, so
                  it is emitted only for fielders who moved more than a step.
  sprint speed    The fastest one-second window, which is the same definition
                  Statcast uses and is far more stable than an instantaneous
                  frame-to-frame maximum -- at 60 Hz a single-frame difference
                  is mostly quantisation noise.
  opportunity     Hang time available before the ball's first touch, paired
                  with the distance the fielder had to cover. Those two are the
                  inputs a catch-probability model is fitted on; this script
                  records the pair rather than asserting a probability.
  home to first   Contact until the batter-runner reaches the first-base bag.
  lead            Distance off the bag at the moment of contact.

COORDINATE FRAME. Everything is emitted in the BALL's frame -- the one
parkGeometry.js documents, with -Z toward centre field and +X toward first base
-- so fielder positions, runner paths, and batted-ball spray all overlay without
a second conversion. The actor structs use a different sign convention; the
calibration step measures it rather than assuming it.

BASE COORDINATES ARE MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. An unoccupied runner slot parks
exactly on its bag, so the session itself says where first, second and third are
in this park. That beats deriving them from a nominal base path, and it means a
park with an unusual infield is handled without a special case.

# fielders converging on a ball are glided toward it at whatever speed the game
# needs, up to 29 u/s. Both are perfectly straight-line, constant-velocity
# motion frame to frame, so smoothness cannot tell them apart; only magnitude

# unheld in mid-air, then launches far harder than any ordinary throw. Both in
# the first real session flew at 182 and 208 mph against a normal spread of 79

# than the speed: nothing else in a live play stops all nine actors at once.

# grouped by that fielder it is a constant to within 0.03 mph across different

# Buddy Throw adds a fourth: a second of frozen cutscene between release and

# WHAT DROVE THE FIELDER BACK. `classify_carry_motion` was built out of the
# operator's own reading of two DK Jungle plays -- "they got pushed back by the
# power of the hit" -- and then the sentence refused to say so, on the grounds
# that a barrel looks the same and the capture holds no field separating them.
# It holds three.
#
# A knockback is an impulse delivered to a fielder who is HOLDING THE BALL, and
# possession begins on an exact frame. Across mario_stadium-20260904T000419Z's
# 17 knockbacks, 16 begin on the frame that fielder first touched the batted
# ball and the 17th begins on the frame a throw arrived in their glove --
# frame-exact, not close. A hazard is under no such obligation: it reaches a
# fielder whenever it gets there, and it sets `knockdown_flag`, which fired zero
# times all game.
#
# So the ball is named when it demonstrably arrived at that instant, the
# knockdown flag outranks it when it fired, and anything else stays unnamed --
# which is the honest answer for the case this was written to protect.
#
# A LEAP OUTRANKS THE BALL. A fielder who catches in mid-air keeps travelling
# after the catch, and that drift passes every knockback test: fastest on the
# first frame, never speeding up, dead straight. It is their own jump. The
# operator flagged one at Peach Ice Garden -- "think it was his momentum of
# running and jumping to the ball" -- and the airborne flag agrees frame-exact:
# of the 25 knockbacks in peach_ice_garden-20260907T234715Z, 3 were airborne on
# the possession frame and 22 were not, and those 3 are the three smallest
# displacements in the set (1.4, 1.7, 1.9 units against a spread that runs to
# 26.8). The jump began before the ball arrived, so where both are true the
# capture cannot separate them and the leap is the one that was already

# clean pickup. The values observed against video and the game's other state:
#
#   1  secure pickup/catch animation
#   2  boot/misplay (ball reached, not secured)
#   3  a second boot/misplay animation. Daisy Cruiser supplied three video-
#      labelled examples: a routine grounder through Blue Kritter, Green Noki
#      failing to secure a star swing before RF caught it, and Diddy Kong
#      booting a ball that had already bounced.
#   5  Yoshi egg contact. All four occurrences in the Daisy Cruiser session
#      were Yoshi's captain star swing reaching a fielder; the forced first
#      bobble is the mechanic, not an ordinary fielding failure.
#   7  intentional diving toss/redirection to a nearby teammate. A chemistry
#      Buddy Throw can accompany it, but chemistry is not required.
#
# Values 2 and 3 are ordinary failed contacts. Value 5 is retained separately
# so it cannot become an error or teach the ordinary OAA model. Value 7 is a
# secure, intentional toss rather than a failure.

# HOW FAR A FIELDER CAN POSSIBLY REACH, in units, measured in three dimensions

#
# The action byte is an animation state, not a claim about the ball: it fires
# for one frame as a fly ball sails overhead, and the tracker .exe turns that
# single frame into "X bobbled the ball!". Two such windows exist in the
# archive -- Donkey Kong with the ball 34.9u above him at DK Jungle, Baby DK
# with it 26.0u above him at Bowser Castle -- and in both the ball was a home
# run that no one came near.
#
# The bound is measured, not assumed: across 233 contacts the game's own
# `last_contact_fielder` confirms, the largest separation at the moment of
# contact is 6.29u, and the largest at a MISS the capture recorded is 8.71u.
# Twelve units is comfortably outside everything a fielder has ever actually
# touched and far inside the two overhead balls, so a window beyond it is an
# animation that coincided with a ball, not a play on one.

# there with the throw. Half a second: long enough that a runner at a measured
# 9 u/s has covered about 4.5 units, short enough that it stays inside the play.
CLOSE_PLAY_LOOKBACK_FRAMES = 30

# A CLOSE PLAY IS A DIFFERENCE IN TIME, NOT IN DISTANCE, and reading it off the
# gap in units was wrong in both directions.
#
# A runner is at the bag when they are inside this radius -- every runner
# standing on a measured bag in the archive sits 0.78-0.82 units from its
# centre. The frame they first get inside it and the frame the ball arrives are
# both measured, and `margin_s` is the difference: negative when the runner beat
# the throw, positive when the throw beat the runner.
#
# WHY THE OLD READING FAILED. Distance-at-arrival conflates the margin with the
# runner's speed. A runner at 12 u/s is four units from first a third of a
# second before reaching it, so every close play at first -- which is always
# taken at full speed -- failed a three-unit gate; and a runner who beat the
# throw two seconds ago is 0.8 units from the bag standing still, so the
# closing-speed test that was there to exclude them excluded every runner who
# WON a close play as well. In peach_ice_garden-20260907T234715Z the two gates
# selected disjoint sets: five throws inside three units, six with a runner
# still closing, no overlap, and the game narrated zero close plays. Measured in
# time the same session has five, at +0.18, +0.33, +0.37, +0.42 and -0.47 s.
RUNNER_AT_BASE_UNITS = 1.5

# How far past the ball's arrival to keep looking for the runner reaching the

# five above are outs by under half a second.

# HOW THE APPROACH TO THE BALL IS CLASSIFIED (`catch_type`, actor +0x2AC).
#
# The fielding AI picks its approach before the ball arrives, writes the choice
# to this byte, and clears it on the frame the glove closes. The values were
# read off three archived sessions (wario_stadium, mario_stadium,
# peach_ice_garden -- 433 windows) and one live one:
#
#   1  ordinary catch. The fielder is standing still for the whole window.
#   2  catching a THROW. The countdown at +0x2A5 equals the frames of throw
#      flight still to come, and every window ends on a receiver's catch.
#   3  DIVE. In all 55 of them the fielder is still running at full step at the
#      moment of the catch and keeps sliding for several frames afterwards,
#      which no type-1 window ever does. Those that end in possession take the
#      ball at a height of ~0; those that do not are the balls that carry
#      through to the outfielder behind.
#   5  CLAMBER. The fielder climbs the wall; this is not a dive.
#   6  LEAP. This is the only value the airborne flag at +0x22E accompanies
#      (30/30), and it is what the 18u-24u catches at the wall are.
#   7  a dash with real displacement (~2.1u) that is not yet resolved to a
#      named mechanic, so it is reported with its raw code and nothing else.
#
# THE AIRBORNE FLAG IS NOT A DIVE DETECTOR and never was: it fires for 6 and
# never for 3. That is why every dive in the archive read as an ordinary play.
#
# 0x2B3 and 0x2B4 both read 2 for exactly the type-3 windows and 0 or 1 for
# every other type across all four sessions, so they remain a free cross-check
# if this classification is ever doubted.
#
# Type 3 says a fielder used the single dive/special-action input. The character
# mapping distinguishes an ordinary dive from Super Dive, Tongue Catch,
# Suction Catch, Magical Catch, Piranha Catch, Keeper Catch, and the three Bro
# throws. The derivation keeps the raw approach and tracker_abilities.mjs names
# the character-specific animation.

    home runs. It leaves no action-byte window and no possession, so a play

    eight windows, four reading 2 and four reading 1, and the tracker log
    announces exactly four buddy jumps -- Peach once and Mario three times. The
    four flag-2 windows are those four plays, fielder for fielder; none of the

    who cannot be boosted over an outfield wall. So 2 is the Buddy Jump and 1

# --- the incremental state machine ------------------------------------------
#
# WHY THIS IS A CLASS. The derivation was always an incremental forward state
# machine -- it opens a play when the ball leaves the plate and closes one at
# the dead ball, and nothing in it ever looks back past the play it is in. It
# just happened to be spelled as a loop inside main(), which meant the only
# thing that could run it was a finished recording.
#
# The live collector needs the same answers during the game, and the one thing
# that must not happen is a second implementation: two derivations that agree
# on most plays and quietly disagree on the interesting ones would be worse
# than having no live numbers at all, because the live page would look right.
# So the loop moved here, and both callers feed it the same snapshots built by
# the same SnapshotBuilder.
#
# The postgame pass over the raw .bin remains authoritative. Live output is the
# same code reaching the same conclusion earlier, and it is labelled as live.

    play that was still open.

    Replay suppression is incremental and equivalent to the batch pass it
