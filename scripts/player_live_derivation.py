"""Run the play derivation while the game is still being played.

The collector already reads every frame; this turns those frames into finished
plays at the dead ball instead of hours later, without changing what it writes
to disk. Three rules shape the whole module:

  1. THE RAW CAPTURE IS UNTOUCHED. The .bin and its header are written exactly
     as before, and the postgame pass over them stays authoritative. Live
     derivation is an extra consumer of frames the collector already had in
     hand, never a substitute for the recording.

  2. ONE IMPLEMENTATION. Snapshots come from player_tracking_io.SnapshotBuilder
     and plays from derive_player_metrics.PlayDeriver -- the same two objects
     the postgame pass uses. There is no live-specific derivation to drift.

  3. A CALIBRATION THAT WAS NOT CONFIRMED EMITS NO PLAYS. Postgame, the position
     offset is scored over the whole session before anything is derived. Live
     there is no such luxury: the offset has to be chosen at frame zero and the
     wrong one produces confident, plausible, wrong numbers rather than an
     error. So the offset is checked against the game itself -- a fielder
     holding the ball stands exactly on it, to the float -- and until enough of
     those coincidences have been seen, plays are derived but withheld.

     PITCHES ARE NOT WITHHELD, because nothing in one can be wrong for that
     reason: a pitch record is read entirely from the state scalars -- the
     count, the batter, the two swing animation counters -- and none of them is
     a coordinate. `take_pitches` returns them whatever the calibration says.

The check is cheap because it is the same coincidence `locked_fielder` already
looks for, and it is decisive because it cannot happen by accident: two
unrelated float triples do not agree to within 0.05 units on three axes.
